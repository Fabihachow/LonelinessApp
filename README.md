# LonelinessApp
Understanding and addressing loneliness in Canada is crucial.

Mostly for improving public health, enhancing social well-being, reducing economic costs, and informing effective policy-making.

By analyzing loneliness trends, we can support targeted interventions and improve the overall quality of life for Canadians.

I have created an app that is able to predict how much the person is lonely based on gender and other selected sociodemographic characteristics.

## In this project:
I will be using these websites to scrape and collect the data.

I have used The random forest Classifier to create my model for my app.

I have used Vscode with streamlit to deploy my App.
